# traffic_violation_detection
Built a real-time traffic violation detection system using computer vision techniques. Processed traffic video streams to detect moving vehicles and applied stop-line crossing logic to identify red-signal violations. Visualized detected vehicles and violations with bounding boxes for effective monitoring.
